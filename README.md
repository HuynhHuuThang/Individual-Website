# Individual-Website
# Folder Structure Recommend
When designing a **website development folder structure** for a **microservices architecture**, it's important to maintain clarity, modularity, and scalability. Here are some **best practices** to follow:  

---

## **1. High-Level Folder Structure**
A typical microservices-based web application may have multiple services, each with its own repository or contained within a monorepo.  

### **Option 1: Multi-Repo Approach (Recommended for Large Applications)**
Each microservice is a separate repository, independently deployable. The folder structure inside each repository follows the best practices below.

```
/service-auth/        # Authentication Service Repo
    /src/
    /config/
    /tests/
    /docs/
/service-user/        # User Management Service Repo
    /src/
    /config/
    /tests/
    /docs/
/service-payment/     # Payment Service Repo
    /src/
    /config/
    /tests/
    /docs/
```

### **Option 2: Monorepo Approach (Good for Small Teams)**
All microservices are kept in a single repository with separate directories.

```
/microservices/
    /auth-service/
    /user-service/
    /payment-service/
    /gateway/
    /shared-libs/
    /configs/
    /scripts/
    /docs/
```

---

## **2. Best Folder Structure for a Single Microservice**
Each microservice should be self-contained, following the **separation of concerns** principle.

```
/auth-service/
    /src/                # Source code (main logic)
        /controllers/    # API controllers
        /routes/         # Route definitions
        /services/       # Business logic
        /models/         # Database models
        /middlewares/    # Middleware functions
        /utils/          # Utility functions/helpers
        /config/         # Configuration files
        /db/             # Database migrations & seeds
    /tests/              # Unit & integration tests
    /public/             # Static files (if needed)
    /scripts/            # Deployment & maintenance scripts
    /docs/               # API documentation, README files
    /config/             # Environment and config files
    /logs/               # Log files (ignored in version control)
    /node_modules/       # Dependencies (ignored in Git)
    .gitignore
    package.json
    Dockerfile           # Containerization
    README.md
```

---

## **3. Frontend Structure in Microservices**
Frontend applications in microservices architecture can follow a **modular** structure.

```
/frontend-app/
    /src/
        /components/       # Reusable UI components
        /pages/            # Page-level components
        /services/         # API calls (e.g., Axios services)
        /hooks/            # Custom React/Vue/Angular hooks
        /context/          # Global state management
        /utils/            # Helper functions
        /assets/           # Static files (images, icons, etc.)
    /public/               # Public assets like index.html
    /tests/                # Unit & integration tests
    /styles/               # CSS, SCSS, Tailwind, etc.
    .gitignore
    package.json
    Dockerfile
    README.md
```

---

## **4. API Gateway Structure**
If you use an API gateway for routing, authentication, and security, structure it like this:

```
/api-gateway/
    /src/
        /routes/         # Route definitions
        /middlewares/    # Authentication, logging, etc.
        /services/       # Communication with microservices
        /config/         # Gateway configurations
    /tests/
    Dockerfile
    README.md
```

---

## **5. CI/CD & Deployment**
For streamlined deployment, maintain a proper DevOps structure:

```
/devops/
    /docker/              # Docker configurations
    /kubernetes/          # Kubernetes manifests
    /terraform/           # Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
    /ci-cd/               # Jenkins/GitHub Actions pipelines
```

---

## **6. Shared Libraries**
If multiple microservices need shared functionalities, place them in a separate module.

```
/shared-libs/
    /logging/
    /authentication/
    /utils/
```

---

## **Key Best Practices**
1. **Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each microservice should focus on one functionality.
2. **Use Separate Repositories (if needed):** Allows independent deployment and scaling.
3. **Keep Configurations Outside the Codebase:** Use `.env` or a centralized configuration service.
4. **Ensure Modular Frontend Design:** Use Micro Frontends for better separation.
5. **Implement Version Control:** Use Git with proper branching strategies.
6. **Follow Standard Naming Conventions:** Keep directories and files consistent.
